## Usage

Bootstrap your new project using this template with:

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest --template aholbreich/astrostart_TD
```

Alternatively clone this repo and just start coding. The following commands should be helpful:


### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
I'm in favor of `pnpm` but `npm` and yarn would work as well.

| Command                 | Action                                           |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`              | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `pnpm build`            | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`          | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

if  `pnpm preview`  is not working for you, you can workaround with:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm dlx serve dist
```

## Dependencies

- Astro 5.7
- Astro Icon
- Astro SEO
- Astro MDX
- Tailwind CSS 4
- DaisyUI 5
- Netlify

## Configuration & Customization

Simple configuration can be found in `src/lib/config.ts`
There are just a few demonstration components, you can delete them, ignore them, adapt them whatever fist you.

### TypeSctipt
Everything in place. If you don't use VSCode Astro Plugin install @astrojs/ts-plugin to get full TS support. (Needed config already added)
```bash
pnpm add @astrojs/ts-plugin
```

### DaisyIU. 
You can also ignore DaisyUI or carve it out by removing @plugin "daisyui"; from global.css and (optionally remove package)

## Collaboration

Feel free to provide your feedback or feature requirements.

### TODO

* Add more DaisyUI components
* Add some more sitempap example/doc
* Add MDX demonstration
